# City-Bike-Project-Management-Analytics-with-Tableau

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
## Task

Optionally, you may merge multiple datasets from different periods. The folloowing are the quetions you may wish to tackle, especially if you are working with merged dataset.
